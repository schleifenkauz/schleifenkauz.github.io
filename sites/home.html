    Welcome to my website!
</h1>

<p>
I currently study piano at the University of Music and Theatre Munich.
Before that, I studied philosophy, completing my Bachelor's thesis on the role of musical metaphors in Wittgenstein's later philosophy
(<a href="../pdf/bachelorarbeit.pdf">available here, in German</a>).

At night, I compose music and develop music software to explore and realize my ideas.
This website serves as a space to share <a href="./index.html?q=audio">my music</a> and to provide download links for my <a href="./index.html?q=ponticello">software projects</a>.

If you have questions or are interested in my work, feel free to <a href="./index.html?q=contact">get in touch</a>.
