        Welcome to my website! <br>
        I currently study piano at the University of Music and Theatre Munich 
        while writing my Bachelor thesis in philosophy
        about the role of musical metaphors in Wittgenstein late philosophy. <br>
        During the nights I compose (mostly electronic) music 
        and develop music software that helps me implement some my ideas.  
        I use this website to upload <a href="./index.html?q=audio">some of my music</a> 
        and host download links for my <a href="./index.html?q=software">software</a>.
        If you have any questions or are interested in my work you can contact me <a href="./index.html?q=contact">here</a>. <br>
        Greetings, <br>
        Nikolaus
