<h2>Ponticello</h2>

<em>Ponticello</em> is a composition environment for electronic music based on the audio programming language <a href="https://supercollider.github.io/">SuperCollider</a>.
<br/>
It grew out of a need I face when composing with SuperCollider.
I really like the versatility and conciseness of audio programming 
and that this compositional medium guides my view on an emerging piece 
in a way that is completely different from traditional musical notation. 

But there are a lot of cases where I want to look at a piece of music not as a text-file,
but as a graphical score, with musical time flowing from left to right, 
simulatenous events being at the same horizontal position,
while retaining the versatility of SuperColliders approach to musical organization.

<br/>

Ponticello attempts to deliver a useful bridge between the world of text-based audio programming 
and the intuitivity of graphical score representations,
utilizing and combining concepts from both notational paradigmas.

<!-- <br/>
Just like in SuperCollider, you can define <em>SynthDef</em>s using code.
And you can instantiate them on the server by creating <em>Synth</em>s programatically. -->

<h4>Installation</h4>

Ponticello uses the SuperCollider platform for audio synthesis. 
It can be downloaded <a href="https://supercollider.github.io/downloads.html">here</a>.
<br/>
Ponticello can be installed by executing one of the following code snippets in the shell, depending on your operating system. 
<br>
(An appropriate <em>Java Runtime Environment</em> and the <em>JavaFX SDK</em> are both automatically downloaded if you don't have them installed on your system.)

<h4>Windows (PowerShell)</h4>
